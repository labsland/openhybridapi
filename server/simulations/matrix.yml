serial-dut2sim:
  # A serial communication scheme with numbered latch, pulse, inupt channels, and output channels
  # There must be a "gpios" section to use this!

  # Define Data
  latch: 0 # Start sending data
  pulse: 1 # Output data is valid
  outputs: [2, 3] # List of GPIO output channels (optional)
  inputs: [] # List of GPIO input channels (optional)
  num_pulses: 216 # The number of pulses per latch

  # Example File Inputs
  samples:
    # Files must have the following format: "01001001" (or whatever)
